Spam Message Classification using LSTM (PyTorch)

This project builds a text classification model that predicts whether a message is spam or not spam.

It includes text preprocessing, vocabulary creation, model training, evaluation, and prediction on unseen text.

This project is inspired by IBM learning material, with modifications and additional improvements.
